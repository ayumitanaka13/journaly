2020/12/15 2020/12/18 Canada Vancouver Bright days, Vancouver! 
I went to the lighthouse park in Vancouver. Awesome park with great viewpoints on the different spots. If you love spending time out at the seashore and love hiking, watching the sun rises and sets. I swear this place is the best to visit for you. I had a great time out there enjoying the decent views and got a chance to see the beautiful sunset view there✌🏻
